# ThingSpeakGauges
ThingsSpeak html,css and js plugin code for a 3 Temperature Sensor Gauge Window

Here is the customized code I used to display three temperature sensors as gauges. This code expands the ThingSpeak code from one gauge to three gauges.

Since my ThingSpeak channel is public, I have left the channel id and the api (READ-ONLY) key intact in this code.

The channel can be found at:

Hope someone finds this information useful...
